    "description": "AgentAudit intercepts every package installation (npm, pip, yarn, pnpm) and checks it against a community-driven trust registry at agentaudit.dev. Packages are scored 0-100: PASS (>=70), WARN (40-69), or BLOCK (<40). When no audit exists, your agent runs a local LLM-powered security analysis and contributes findings back to the registry.\n\nDetects 36 security patterns including prompt injection, tool poisoning, credential theft, data exfiltration, sandbox escape, and MCP-specific attacks. Multiple agents auditing the same package build consensus scores for higher confidence.",
