# ecap-security-auditor — Retest Report

**Date:** 2026-02-02  
**Tester:** Fresh AI agent, zero prior knowledge  
**Approach:** Read SKILL.md cold, follow instructions exactly

---

## Test 1: Security Gate — Known Package "coding-agent"

**Result: ✅ PASS**

### Steps followed (per SKILL.md Gate Flow):

1. **Query Trust Registry:** `GET /api/findings?package=coding-agent` → 6 findings returned (2 critical, 2 high, 2 medium)
2. **Hash Verification:** Skipped — coding-agent is not locally installed, no files to verify
3. **Calculate Trust Score:**
   - Penalties: 2× critical (-50) + 2× high (-30) + 2× medium (-16) = **96**
   - Trust Score = max(0, 100 - 96) = **4**
4. **Decision Table:** Score < 40 → 🔴 BLOCK
   - Message: `🔴 coding-agent — Trust Score: 4/100. Blocked. Run audit to investigate.`

**Verdict:** The Gate Flow documentation is clear and easy to follow step-by-step. The penalty formula, decision table, and output format all worked without ambiguity.

## Test 2: Security Gate — Unknown Package "some-random-package-12345"

**Result: ✅ PASS**

- `GET /api/findings?package=some-random-package-12345` → `{"findings": [], "total": 0}`
- SKILL.md says: "No report exists" → 🔴 Auto-audit → `"🔴 [package] — No audit data. Running security audit now..."`
- Flow diagram clearly shows: "Report exists? No → Go to AUTO-AUDIT"
- Auto-audit steps are documented: read all files, follow audit-prompt.md, build JSON, upload, re-run gate

**Verdict:** Instructions are clear. The "what to do when nothing exists" path is well-documented.

---

## Test 3: Hash Verification

**Result: ✅ PASS (script works, hashes differ as expected)**

```
bash scripts/verify.sh ecap-security-auditor
```

Output:
- ✅ scripts/upload.sh, scripts/register.sh, prompts/review-prompt.md, README.md — all OK
- ❌ SKILL.md — HASH MISMATCH (local differs from audited version)
- ❌ prompts/audit-prompt.md — HASH MISMATCH

Exit code 1 (failure). Output is clear: shows package name, repo, commit, per-file pass/fail with both hashes for mismatches, and a summary line.

**Verdict:** Script works well. Output is human-readable and informative. The mismatches are expected (files were updated after the last audit hash snapshot).

---

## Test 4: Mini-Audit + Upload

**Result: ✅ PASS**

1. Read SKILL.md + prompts/audit-prompt.md — both comprehensive
2. Created report in documented JSON format with 1 low-severity finding (plaintext API key storage)
3. Uploaded: `bash scripts/upload.sh /tmp/retest-report.json`
4. Response: `Report ID: 40, Findings created: 1, ECAP-2026-0829`

**Verdict:** Upload script works perfectly. JSON format requirements are clear (the "Important" note about required top-level fields saved me from nesting errors). The whole audit→upload flow is smooth.

## Test 5: API Endpoints Spot-Check

**Result: ✅ PASS (all 3 endpoints working)**

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `GET /api/health` | ✅ | `{"status":"healthy"}`, DB connected, 57 findings, 17 skills, 5 agents |
| `GET /api/leaderboard` | ✅ | Returns array with ecap0: 930 points, 39 reports, 57 findings |
| `GET /api/agents/ecap0` | ✅ | Full profile: severity breakdown, 34 skills audited, recent findings/reports |

---

## Summary

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1. Security Gate (known package) | ✅ PASS |
| 2. Security Gate (unknown package) | ✅ PASS |
| 3. Hash Verification | ✅ PASS |
| 4. Mini-Audit + Upload | ✅ PASS |
| 5. API Endpoints | ✅ PASS |

## Overall Grade: 9/10

**What works great:**
- SKILL.md is comprehensive and followable by a first-time agent
- Gate Flow diagram + decision table = zero ambiguity on what to do
- Trust Score formula is simple and clearly documented
- Scripts (verify.sh, upload.sh) work out of the box
- API is stable and responsive
- audit-prompt.md is thorough with good false-positive guidance

**Minor issues (-1 point):**
- Hash mismatches on SKILL.md/audit-prompt.md suggest integrity hashes aren't updated after file edits — could confuse a new agent into thinking the skill is tampered
- The `risk_score` vs `Trust Score` naming is slightly confusing (risk_score is 0=safe/100=bad, Trust Score is 100=safe/0=bad — they're inverses). SKILL.md does explain `Trust Score = 100 - risk_score` but it takes a careful read

**Bottom line:** A fresh agent can pick this up and run the full security gate + audit workflow without any hand-holding. Well done.
